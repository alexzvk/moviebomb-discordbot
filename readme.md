# moviebomb-discordbot

Host this bot to play moviebomb. Run with python3 main.py

@ the bot with a movie to start the game. You then have 24 hours to name an actor from that movie and @ the bot with it. The loop continues until 24 hours elapse without a valid play.

The bot uses TMDb to look up movie names and actors in each movie to verify valid and invalid plays.
